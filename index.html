    <h3>About Me</h3> 
    <p>I am a multidisciplinarian with a  paradoxical specialisation in all things systems thinking, holistic integration and cross-domain strategy. I help people with too many complex projects and interests address their root problems by big-picture meta-thinking (purpose, structure, synergy) and the application of my idiosyncratic frameworks I've developed as initial personal experiments. </p>
    <p>My journey began during a certain worldwide epidemic in 2020 that allowed me to reflect and decide to commit to a life marked by intellectual curiosity and purpose. Since then, for 5 good years I've developed my own learning and review systems, personal and professional development schemas, projects and programs that allow me to wake up daily with clear goals and the continual desire to contribute to a better world.</p>

    <h3>Seasonal Note</h3>
    <p>I am getting in a good rhythm of project work – much of it is unfortunately still in early stages, but we're working through it steadily and sensibly. If you happen to be interested in my works in progress, they are <a href="https://www.notion.so/aongus/Angus-Forge-2025-c724e33124b84fb89c7d5af978c0ae25?source=copy_link">here</a>. </p>
